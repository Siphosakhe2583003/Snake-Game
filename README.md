### Just a snake game.

Created with the raylib framework using the [raylib-cpp-starter](https://github.com/CapsCollective/raylib-cpp-starter/)

# Todo's
1. ~~Create the snake game.~~
2. Switch the game from being player base to AI base by keeping track of the game state in a convinient way for the AI agent.
3. Add classical path finding algorithms (Uniform Cost Search, Hamiltonian Path).
4. Train an AI agent to play the game using Q-Learning without using any machine learning frameworks.
